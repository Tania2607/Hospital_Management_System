# Hospital_Management_System
 🏥 Hospital Management System in C++

This is a console-based Hospital Management System built using C++.  
It allows hospital staff to add, view, and search for patient records using a simple menu-driven interface.


📜 About the Project

This project simulates a basic hospital management interface using object-oriented programming in C++.  
It uses classes and vectors to manage dynamic patient records efficiently.
🚧 No external database or file handling is implemented — all data is lost when the program exits. This can be a future extension.

> ⚙️ Developed as a part of C++ practice project for beginner-level system design.


 ✨ Features

- ✅ Add new patient records with full details
- ✅ Display all stored patient records
- ✅ Search patient by ID
- ❌ No file storage (in-memory only)
- ❌ No billing or appointment system (can be added as an extension)



🧾 Technologies Used

- C++
- Standard Template Library (STL) – `vector`
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Console UI



 💻 How to Run

 🪟 On Windows (using g++)
```bash
g++ hospital.cpp -o hospital
hospital

🐧 On Linux / Mac
bash
Copy code
g++ hospital.cpp -o hospital
./hospital

📁 Required File
Make sure your code is saved as: hospital.cpp
You can rename it based on your preference.
